## Abstract

Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally
intensive non-linear inverse problem.  What is more, the modeling must
take the Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional
scale or greater.  We present a regularized non-linear gravity inversion
method that has a low computational footprint and employs a spherical
Earth approximation.  To achieve this, we combine the highly efficient
Bott's method with smoothness regularization and a discretization of the
anomalous Moho into tesseroids (spherical prisms).  The computational
efficiency of our method is attained by harnessing the fact that all
matrices involved are sparse.  The inversion results are controlled by
three hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter, the anomalous Moho
density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth.  We estimate the
regularization parameter using the method of hold-out cross-validation.
Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the reference depth
using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points.  We apply the
proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American
continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data.  The final
Moho model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and
seismological data.  The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is
worse in the Andes and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and
Patagonia, and along the Atlantic coast.  Similarly to previous results,
the model suggests a thinner crust of 30-35 km under the Andean foreland
basins.  Discrepancies with the seismological data are greatest in the
Guyana Shield, the central Solimões and Amazonas Basins, the Paraná
Basin, and the Borborema province.  These differences suggest the
existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that were unaccounted
for during gravity data processing.


## Reproducing the results


### Executing the code online

You can run the Jupyter notebooks online without installing anything
through the free [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) webservice:

[mybinder.org/repo/pinga-lab/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids](http://mybinder.org:/repo/pinga-lab/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids)

Start by navigating to the `code` folder and choose a notebook to execute.
Beware that the CRUST1.0 and South American Moho notebooks will probably not
be able to run on Binder because they take too long (a few days).
If you want to try out the method start with the `code/synthetic-simple.ipynb`
notebook or see how the figures for the paper are generated in the
`code/paper-figures.ipynb` notebook.
**Tip**: use `Shift + Enter` to execute a code cell.

If you want to run the full inversion on your machine, follow the steps below.


### Running things on your machine

First, download a copy of all files in this repository:

* [Download a zip archive](https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids/archive/master.zip)
* Or clone the [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

        git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids.git


### Setting up your environment

You'll need a working Python **2.7** environment with all the standard
scientific packages installed (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc).  The easiest
(and recommended) way to get this is to download and install the
[Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).
Make sure you get the **Python 2.7** version.

All required dependencies are specified in the `environmet.yml` file.
The exact versions of every dependency are also specified in the `conda-*.lock`
files. The lock files can be used to create an exact version of the environment
used in the paper for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

You can use `conda` package manager (included in Anaconda) to create a virtual
environment with all the required packages installed. First, unzip the contents
of this repository (if you've downloaded the zip file) and `cd` into the root
of the repository (where `environment.yml` and the `conda-*.lock` files are
located). Next, run the following command in a terminal (substituting the
appropriate lock file for your operating system):

    conda create -n moho --file conda-linux-64.lock

This will create the virtual environment based on the specifications in
`environment.yml` and install all required dependencies.
To activate the conda environment, run

    source activate moho

or, if you're on Windows,

    activate moho

This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.


### Running the inversions and generating figures

The inversion and figure generation are all run inside Jupyter notebooks.  To
execute them, you must first start the notebook server by going into the
repository folder and running (make sure you have the `conda` environment
enabled first):

    jupyter notebook

This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
console interface.  In the page, go into the `code` folder and select the
notebook that you wish to view/run.

Here what a notebook looks like running in Firefox:

![Screenshot of the Jupter notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinga-lab/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids/master/screenshot-jupyter-notebook.png?token=AARtIq6LujCeiRLJLIjqQyqAGnV3KS0aks5W_CY1wA%3D%3D)

The notebook is divided cells (some have text while other have code).  Each can
be executed using `Shift + Enter`. Executing text cells does nothing and
executing code cells runs the code and produces it's output.  To execute the
whole notebook, run all cells in order.

All results figures in the paper are generated by the
`code/paper-figures.ipynb` notebook.
